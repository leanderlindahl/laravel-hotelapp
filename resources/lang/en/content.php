	'hotel_description' => "<p>Elisetorp is an old little converted Skånegård, which has been run as agriculture a long time ago. The farm converted to fruit growing and we have been working for several years to focus on Bed & Breakfast and ceramics. As a guest of ours you have wonderful views of our apple trees, Stenshuvud National Park and the sea and if you are lucky you can also get a glimpse of Bornholm directly from your window.</p>

	<p>Here you can sit with the grass between the toes of our apple cultivation and drink your morning coffee in accompaniment with the song of the summer birds. In the yard you can also visit a pottery, here you can follow the pots from turning to finished product. There is also a shop here, see more at www.sagakeramik.se In the ceramics workshop there is an opportunity to try to turn. We have free lending of bikes for the evening and free WIFI.</p>
	
	<p>We have a dining room where guests have breakfast. There you can also sit in the evening if you want to hang out or eat some meditating food. We have coffee, tea, micro, fridge and crockery for guests to borrow.</p>"
